Pumart - Academic Project for Introduction to Robotics Course (MEAM 520) at UPenn. Drawing created on paper using PUMA 260 with inverse kinematics and forward kinematics. MATLAB was used to operate the PUMA 260. Any drawing given is extracted to create a edge image which is then parsed to give IK waypoints.
